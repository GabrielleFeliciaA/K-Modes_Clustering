# Implementation of the K-Modes Algorithm for Supporting Planning Decision Making Student Academics
Academic planning is a service provided by the academic advisors to help students in preparing and completing lectures through an systematic, measurable and planned services to be able to graduate on time. Advisor academics themselves are tasked with encouraging students achieve academic achievements for the sake of prepare for a future career accordingly respective abilities. In fact, a lot of Academic plans are hampered and fail because various factors, one of them is difference student characteristics. The aim of this study is to assist academic advisors in determining student groups which need more academic guidance intensely, so that students can achieve targets, namely graduate on time based on characteristic analysis students. This study implemented the K-Modes algorithm method. The K-Modes algorithm is a clustering algorithm suitable for use on categorical data. In determining the best number of clusters, We use the evaluation metrics method in the form of Elbow Method and also the Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH Index). The best number of clusters is the number of the cluster that has the maximum CH Index value, where in this paper there are 4 clusters, namely cluster 0 has 3,931 data, cluster 1 has 3,141 data, cluster 2 with 2,251 data, and cluster 3 a total of 1,951 data.
